    <h1>Finding Base Camp</h1>
    <div class="box">
        <p>I've been rather fascinated and involved with meditation for two years. This year, I began meditating with a community called Evolving Ground. Evolving Ground is a group of meditators who are devoted to walking an individualized life-affirming spiritual path. My teacher, Jared, likes to describe the first stretch of the path with a metaphor: We are all wandering a vast wilderness full of wonders and mysteries. Mountains, rivers, trees, meadows, trails, and bridges abound in every direction. The variety and magnitude is dizzying, disorienting, terrifying, awe-inspiring.
        You may be in this wilderness forever. Nobody you encounter really knows for sure. What we do know, is that somewhere in this wilderness is a place called "the Base Camp". Once you've reached the Base Camp, you'll finally be able to rest, and get a better idea of what this place really is, and how to proceed in exploring it. The first job of our teachers is to help us find Base Camp. How? Why?</p>
        
        <p>The first technique any teacher in Evolving Ground is likely to teach you is called Opening Awareness. The method is simply to sit comfortably (so probably not on the floor or a cushion unless you're a yoga nut), notice when you're becoming involved with your thoughts or feelings, and release your involvement. This may sound simple. It is. It's so simple that it's incredibly difficult without practice. Our brains love to make things more complicated than they really are, which is exactly why we train in this way. Through this training we can find clarity in the absurdly simple. In time, the practice of OA can help us reach a <em>state of being</em> where we are completely uninvolved, just observing. My teachers call this state Spacious Presence. Spacious Presence is our first path into the aforementioned Base Camp.</p>
        
        <p>Described another way, Spacious Presence is a moment in time that you fully accept without making any attempt to change or analyze it. There is a very big difference between being almost in Spacious Presence and being in Spacious Presence. Even dipping into it for one moment turns your whole life on its head. I'm going to attempt to describe Spacious Presence and its effects in more detail, but know that this experience is too nuanced to be communicated through words. You can only really understand it by experiencing it yourself, and this takes most people years of practice. What I can hopefully do with my imperfect description and commentary is give you somewhat of an idea of why you should try. In Spacious Presence you see a world that is just fine how it is. No good, no evil, no pleasure, no pain. Just <a href="https://vividness.live/" target="_blank">vividness</a>, aliveness. You see that whether you're realizing it or not, beneath the story of every moment, every moment is perfect.</p>
        
        <p>Experiencing a moment this way changes your relationship with death, loss, failure, and disappointment. What can you be missing out on if all of life is secretly wholeness? With training the display of perfection shines through each moment's story at all times, and you can get involved with the world and try to make things better without losing sight of the fact that things are perfect the way they are. This makes you a much more confident, consistent, and effective agent of positive change. </p>
        
        <p>In Spacious Presence it becomes easier to see the aspects of the world and yourself which are capable of healing and improving when left alone. You see how much potential and power there really is in just being open and receptive sometimes, rather than constantly attempting to infuse each situation with what you actively think it needs. When you see the power of receptiveness, you also have more power to choose when to get involved, instead of wearing yourself and others thin by thinking you need to take an active approach towards every problem. In this way you become more patient, because you see how being spaciously present, just watching and listening lovingly without adding anything, is an action, and often an action that a situation or a person is in dire need of.</p>
        
        <p>When I speak of innate perfection and receptiveness, this should not be mistaken as encouragement to be complacent with systems of oppression and injustice. This path just gives you the ability to observe and work on these systems more honestly and intimately by empathizing with the compassion, fear, and delusion of the human beings behind them, rather than get caught up in looking at them with disgust and shame in the hopes that your emotions can somehow wipe them out or separate you from them.</p>
        
        <p>
        Before finding Base Camp, you fear that you might be missing out on something essential to life, and that the timer of death is constantly counting down and looming over you, threatening to take away the opportunity to find the *essential thing*. You flail around helplessly moment to moment, deluded with the idea that somehow you can only be happy after some set of circumstances is met in the future, and that the future will somehow be free of something you don't like about the present. This is delusion, because the future will always become the present, and the present will always have struggle, failure, imperfection, impermanence, and above all, uncertainty.
           <em>After</em> finding Base Camp, you become disillusioned with silly things like cosmic hope for salvation, or the idea that you will stop occasionally feeling confused and aimless and overworked once you find the right job, or that you can be completely certain that something you read is true based on authority or instinct. You will always have confusion, suffering, miscommunication, loneliness, pain, and (you can't forget this one) uncertainty. You will always have life's fundamental problems, but you can learn to enjoy living with them.
        </p>
        
        <p>Endless problems mean endless opportunity for growth, novelty, and play. Full awareness of the inevitability of death imbues life with utter preciousness. Absolute uncertainty means there will always be surprises and mysteries. Life will never ever stop being interesting if your eyes and heart are open to it.</p>
        
        <p>This change to your being is not a process of trying to convince yourself you're at peace with these things by reciting affirmations in the mirror or getting people to tell you that you "Seem really confident and spiritual and stuff." This is a fundamental change to your being that occurs due to a direct experience. It's like how if you've flown in an airplane before you never quite look at clouds the same way, because you've flown above them and even through them. They just don't seem so solid anymore. Once you've seen the world from the perspective of Base Camp, death and failure don't seem so solid anymore. They're just another part of the vast, electric, and vivid picture of life.</p>
        
        <p>Ironically this gives you so much more power to succeed, gain clarity, and be surrounded by love. When you're not deluding yourself into thinking there are guarantees, you can meet reality on its own terms, knowing full well you could fail any step of the way. When you're not deluding yourself into thinking there is ever a moment where you have all the pieces and there are no surprises, you can settle in and have clarity about how much you don't know instead of chasing the moment of "pure" clarity by inundating your mind with an indiscriminate horde of every minute detail about a situation. When you're not deluding yourself into thinking you'll stop being lonely if you find someone perfect, or become perfect, you can start loving people who are imperfect, showing them your imperfection, and providing unbridled love for yourself. </p>
        
        <p>Your training doesn't stop once you've found Base Camp, because you'll quickly forget where it is after your first visit. Once you've found it you're always in its orbit, circling ever closer to merging with it entirely like a meteor being pulled into a planet, but this process can be slow and mystifying. It helps to have guidance from others on the same path.</p>
        
        <p>Spacious Presence is also not the final state of realization on the path, it is only the first fruit of the four foundational meditation methods of Evolving Ground. By finding the Base Camp, you begin establishing your ability to freely explore and develop a relationship with the following methods. Ultimately your work is meant to reveal to you what is often called "The Natural State", a temporary state of being which is said to be utterly liberated from delusions about the fundamental nature of experience. I have little clue what this feels like, means, or changes about a person because I'm nowhere near attaining it. In fact, to my knowledge I've only ever spoken to one person who has experienced it. It sounds nice though. I've heard it described as a state of <em>spontaneous congruent action,</em> as in, <em>you just effortlessly do whatever feels appropriate to the situation you're in the whole time.</em></p>
        
        <p>For most, just finding the Base Camp at all through Opening Awareness and Spacious Presence is the center of their practice, and it will be for a long time. Even though I can visit it every now and then, it is still the center of mine. I still get lost in the woods, disoriented, distracted, and confused by all the beautiful and horrifying sights in this wilderness. Eventually, though, I always find my way back, because my mind seeks rest, recovery, and clarity and it knows Base Camp is where to find it. I'm told that for at least a couple of years this will be my practice until I'm like my elders who are so familiar with Base Camp and the infinite paths into it that they can return whenever they like, and remain there as long as they like. I look forward to this day, and press on savoring each moment, relaxing into enjoyment and spacious acceptance wherever I can.</p>
